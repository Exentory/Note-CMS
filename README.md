# Note
###PHP based CMS
Note is a simple lightweight php based cms, capable of managing your posts with a powerful editor. It can be installed using one simple script, and has a build-in update function.
Note can handle multiple user accounts and post types, and will soon have comments!

Note will not takeover your pages, and will dislay posts only where you want it to with a few lines of code.

###Installation
To install Note, download the installer script and place it in the folder that contains your pages. Open the page in your browser and follow the instructions.

You will have to make your own database, and enter the details into the form. Note will try to fill it with tables.
You will then be redirected to the user deployment screen, on which you can create your administrator account.

After you have made the administrator account, you're done!
