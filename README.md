# Note
###PHP based CMS
Watermelone is a simple lightweight php based cms, capable of managing your posts with a powerfull editor. It can be installed using 1 simple script, and has a built in update function.
The CMS can handle multiple user accounts and post types, and will soon have comments built in!

Watermelone will not takeover your page handeling, and will dislay posts only where you want it to with a few lines of code.

###Installation
To install Watermelone, download the installer script and place it in the folder that contains your pages. Open the page in your browser and follow the instructions.

You will have to make your own database, and enter the details into the form. Watermelone will try to populate it.
You will then be redirected to the user deployment screen, on which you can create your administrator account.

After you have made the administrator account, you're done!
